dll section is the visual studio project for the dll mod

modengine section is the mod files that go in modengine2 or the like(from mapstudio/darkscript and whatnot)

the ce section is the fully functional proof of concept stuff for the dll mod. note you may need to mess with the tga ce table a bit to get the script to run but all the pieces are included
